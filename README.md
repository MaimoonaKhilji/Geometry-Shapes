# Geometry-Shapes
A complete java code that draw shapes or geometry and calculate its area using the concept of Polymorphism

This program is based on **Polymorphism** (Static and dynamic polymorphism). This program can calculate the area and display the shape of given geometry. It will take Name of the shape  as an input from user. Then take the inputs of length of sides and calculate the area of the shape. And then print the shape pattern.

This program is consists of Four Classes:
•	Default
•	Triangle
•	Circle
•	Rectangle
•	Square
</pre>

**Dynamic Polymorphism**
( Run Time Polymorphism )

Overrided Methods:          Void Sides ( )	
Classes:	            Overrided in class Triangle, circle, rectangle, square	
Purpose:                    Here, Lengths of sides are taken as input from users.


Overrided Methods:          Void Area ( )	
Classes:	            Overrided in class Triangle, circle, rectangle, square
Purpose:                    Here, Area of the required shape is calculated.

Overrided Methods:          Void Area ( double area )	
Classes:	            Overrided in class Triangle, circle, rectangle, square
Purpose:                    Here, Area of the shape is printed.

Overrided Methods:          Void Shape ( )	
Classes:	            Overrided in class Triangle, circle, rectangle, square
Purpose:                    Here shape or pattern is printed.
